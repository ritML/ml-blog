# ritML

This blog is meant to be THE ALL THINGS ML-related BLOG for MSRIT. The main reason for this initiative is to get everyone to share their knowledge with the community and also strengthen the understanding alongside! The main aim of this blog is make everyone's understanding and knowledge available to everyone in the college (and outside).

Some things to note:
- If you already maintain a personal blog, please feel free to post the same posts here (and even link to your original post).
- This blog uses [Quarto](https://quarto.org) as the tool for blogging. Please go through the [documentation](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/website-blog.html) to familiarize yourself with the workflow.
- If you find it daunting to get it set up, then please don't hesitate to DM me on my socials for help or posting your content for you on your behalf (under your name, of course).
