# ritML

This blog is meant to be THE ALL THINGS ML-related BLOG for MSRIT. The main reason for this initiative is to get everyone to share their knowledge with the community, both at RIT and outside as well, and also strengthen their understanding alongside!

## Contributing Guide

### Quarto

Familiarize yourself with the Quarto blogging process:
- [Quick getting started guide](https://themohitnair.github.io/theskywalkerarena/posts/Post2-Quarto/)
- [The ultimate guide to starting a Quarto blog](https://albert-rapp.de/posts/13_quarto_blog_writing_guide/13_quarto_blog_writing_guide.html#interact-with-your-audience)

### Git/Github Workflow

Here's the process you (ideally) should follow:
- Fork this repo using the button in the top right section of the webpage.
- In the forked repo, create a new branch to write your post in.
- Now clone the forked repo to your local machine using `git clone <your-repo-url>`.
- Create a post. (check [guide](#quarto))
- Stage (`git add .`) and commit (`git commit -m "<message>"`) your changes.
- Push the changes to the forked repo (`git push`).
- In GitHub, submit a pull request to the main branch of the original repo from the newly created branch of the forked repo.
And done! Someone will have a look at the post, suggest changes if any or review the post, and accept the pull request!

### Miscellaneous

Some things to note:
- If you already maintain a personal blog, please feel free to post the same posts here (and even link to your original post). But please try to convert your post to a markdown format so that it becomes easy to integrate into this blog.
- This blog uses [Quarto](https://quarto.org) as the tool for blogging. Please go through the [documentation](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/website-blog.html) to familiarize yourself with the workflow or have a look at the [guide](#quarto).
- If you find it daunting to get this all set up, then please don't hesitate to DM me on my socials for help.
